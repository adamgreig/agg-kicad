# PCB Templates

This directory contains templates for commonly-used PCB shapes (shields, hats, etc.)

## Using a Template

After creating your project, replace the `.kicad_pcb` file with the template. When
you're ready to start layout, open the PCB file and set the reference of the
connector(s) to match the reference in your schematic. Then continue as normal.
